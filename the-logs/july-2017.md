### July 1

Sitting around on a Saturday afternoon, thinking about life goals and such.

Probably going to start slowly assembling the AuraCube again, but it'll still take forever.

Working on reverse engineering the APDS-9960 RGB/Gesture Sensor when not livestreaming-- saving the TCS RGB sensor finish work for the next time I livestream.

Other than that, just reading through the Art of Electronics book, doing some of the labs, and trying to keep my lab in order.
