# June 2017 Logs

##### June 2, 2017

I'm at [the 200OK conference](/200ok.us) today. Gave a talk on Serverless Architectures in Node.JS.

I've been working on an AVR project-- essentially I want to make an AVR chip into an I2C/SPI/whatever peripheral in order to run hardware tests for my bus-pirate npm module. Turns out this [may benefit the bus-pirate firmware project as well](https://github.com/BusPirate/Bus_Pirate/issues/22), so that's fun.

So far, I have the I2C peripheral code \*kind of\* working. You can see more in the [ATMega328 Testing Peripheral](/atmega328-testing-peripheral.md) section for more. Next I want to finish the I2C, then move on to SPI.

[here's the repo for the test peripheral.](https://github.com/nodebotanist/node-bus-pirate-tester)

I'm still noodling with the combination of the SX1509 IO expander and 4x4 LED button grid from SparkFun. I can get colors to show up via PWM, but my soldering in the past has led to a few bugs. Once I fix that and verify it, I want to move it from BusPirate lines to Node via either J5 or mraa on the edison.

Other than that, I might be building light-up armor soon. We will see.

Finally, I intend to more fully document my Serverless Skateboard builds this month.

Then of course there's the monumental task of moving all relevant documentation from the existing publicly-available OneNote Notebook to GitBooks. I basically plan to move info over as I use it, culling old and unused research. I don't ever intend to delete my original notes-- just eventually all updates will end up here.
