### Purpose

This section documents my work in trying to get an ATMega328 to work as an I2C peripheral device for bus pirate testing.

### Author's note

the word "peripheral" is used to replace the word "slave", and "root" replaces "master" in an I2C context. I did this because I don't like using the original language. I really don't care to hear your opinion on the matter; especially if your opinion involves questioning the technical aptitude of those who refuse to use those particular words.
