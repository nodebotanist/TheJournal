Welcome!

This is less of a book in the traditional sense, and more a collection of notes, ideas, research, and documentation. 

It's a journal more than anything else.

It's my robotics work-- from hardware to software, C to Javascript to PCB EAGLE designs. 

Everything herein is open source and all I ask is if you build something because of something you learn from my work, show me-- I love seeing the amazing things others build.
